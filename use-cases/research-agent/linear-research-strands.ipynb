    "A research agent is a Generative AI–powered system built to independently perform research on a defined topic by emulating how a human researcher reasons and operates.\n",

    "#### Research Agent orchestrates four sub agents:\n",
    "#### 1) Scoping - Uses human interaction to define objectives and constraints for the research topic\n",
    "#### 2) Briefing - Defines scope brief for the research using human interaction based scope definition\n",
    "#### 3) Execution - Performs research on topic based on scope brief and generates research content.\n",
    "#### 4) Drafting - Drafts research report based on research content\n",
